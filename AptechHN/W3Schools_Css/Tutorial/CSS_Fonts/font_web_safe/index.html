      <h1>What are Web Safe Fonts?</h1>
      <p>
        Web safe fonts are fonts that are universally installed across all
        browsers and devices.
      </p>

      <h1>Fallback Fonts</h1>
      <p>
        However, there are no 100% completely web safe fonts. <br />
        <br />
        There is always a chance that a font is not found or is not installed
        properly. <br />
        <br />
        Therefore, it is very important to always use fallback fonts.
        <br />
        <br />
        This means that you should add a list of similar "backup fonts" in the
        font-family property. If the first font does not work, the browser will
        try the next one, and the next one, and so on. Always end the list wit a
        generic font family name.
