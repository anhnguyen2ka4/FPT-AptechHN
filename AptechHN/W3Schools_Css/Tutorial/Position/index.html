        <p class="note">
          Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right
          properties. However, these properties will not work unless the
          position property is set first. They also work differently depending
          on the position value.

      <p class="static">Position: static;</p>
      <p class="document">
        HTML elements are positioned static by default. Static positioned
        elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right
        properties. An element with position: static; is not positioned in any
        special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the
        page:
      </p>
      <p class="relative">Position: relative;</p>
      <p class="document">
        An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal
        position. Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a
        relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its
        normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap
        left by the element.

          An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the
          nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the

          no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along
          with page scrolling. Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed
          from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.
