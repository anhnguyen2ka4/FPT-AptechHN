      In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that
      I've been turning over in my mind ever since.
      <i> 'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,'</i> he told me, 'just
      remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that
      you've had.'
